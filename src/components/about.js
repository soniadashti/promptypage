                  We chose to create this web app as many of us in this class are applying to jobs, interviewing and constantly improving our professional accolades, we noticed we don't really have a hub that we store all that information on. We wanted to create an app that we would actually use, and that would find useful, and we believe that a hub to track all your professional pursuits is something that most students/graduates lack, and would add some much needed organization in such a cluttered process.
